This Guid is to store the images on the postgres sql datastore

This solution  with the dragonfly-activerecord fork . Just go to config/initializers/refinery/images.rb Here is a code to do it. First follow dragonfly-activerecord fork steps

In Gemfile:
```
gem 'dragonfly-activerecord' , git: "git://github.com/arpit-clarion/dragonfly-activerecord.git"
bundle
rails generate migration add_dragonfly_storage
```

In the migration file add this code
```
require 'dragonfly-activerecord/migration'

class AddDragonflyStorage < ActiveRecord::Migration
  include Dragonfly::ActiveRecord::Migration
end
```

Run rake db:migrate and add this code:


config/initializers/refinery/images.rb
```
# encoding: utf-8
require 'dragonfly-activerecord/store'
Refinery::Images.configure do |config|
  #...... Your configuration ....
  config.custom_backend_class = 'Dragonfly::ActiveRecord::Store'
  config.custom_backend_opts = {}
  #...... Your configuration ....
end
```
This will change the whole system folder structure set into database. No need to any buckets .

Keep in mind that this system is for those applications which has less images to store as it generates big chunks in db and it converts images on request time.
